# few-shot-link-prediction
Source code for our EACL 2021 paper "[Exploring the Limits of Few-Shot Link Prediction in Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.03419.pdf)" by Dora Jambor, Komal Teru, Joelle Pineau and William Hamilton. In this paper we conduct a systematic study of various few-shot learning methods to understand the extent to which the meta-learning scheme plays a role in the success of these methods. We also perform a synthetic set of experiments to probe into the type of learning signals these models may be exploiting.

We thank the authors of [MetaR](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D19-1431/) for sharing their [codebase](https://github.com/AnselCmy/MetaR), which has been the backbone we used to build upon in our work. 

Instructions on reproducing the experiments will be updated shortly.
